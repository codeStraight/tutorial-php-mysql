```php
// php slide
// first of all let's talk about PHP-SYNTAX
  <?php echo 'Hello codeStraight'; ?>

// php Code starts with "left-angle, question, php" and ends with "question-mark, and right-angle"
// echo is used to display or output content to the web browser "  
// php statement always ends with a semicolon ;

// secondly, of all we are gonna jump into "php-comments":
    // comments are very helpful to take notes or documentation
// This is a single-line comment in PHP

/* 
This is a multiline-line comment in PHP

// add html-template
// add footer
```
```php
// after that let's move on to VARIABLES:

// In PHP, a variable is a placeholder or a container that holds a value. It's a fundamental concept used to store and manipulate various types of data within a script.

// declaring a variable
$myVar = 42;
// naming conventions for variables enhance code-readability and maintainability.

// things to consider while declarig a variable:
    // Start variable names with a dollar sign $.
    // Use descriptive names that reflect the variable's purpose.
    // Use camelCase or underscores to separate words.
    // You can name variables using letters, numbers, and underscores, 
    // must start with a letter or an underscore.eg

$firstName = "John"; // camelCase
$last_name = "Doe"; // Underscore separation

$_myVar1 = 42; //start with underscore

// now if you wana output the variable, you can use "echo" keyword followed by variable or string:
echo $_myVar1;

// you can also embed HTML tags within PHP
echo "<br>";

// if double quotes, output both the string and variable
echo "the number is: $_myVar1 inwords, forty two";

// or you can also concatenate string and variable with period "."
echo "the number is: " . $_myVar1 . " inwords, forty two";

// or you can interpolate variable with {}
echo "the number is: {$_myVar1}  inwords, forty two";

// for styling: css / bootstrap series

// data-type = not needed, supports = strings, integers, floats(double), arrays, e.g:

$myVarStr = "42";

// to check type of string:
echo "type: ".gettype($myVar);

echo "<br> type: ".gettype($myVarSt);

// variables are case-sensitive e.g:
$myVar = "Hello";
$myvar = "World";

echo $myVar;
echo "<br>";
echo $myvar;

// In this code, we have two variables: $myVar and $myvar. Even though the variable names are similar, PHP treats them as distinct due to the difference in their case.

// Variable scope
// in PHP Variable scope refers to where a variable is accessible or visible in your code . There are primarily two types of variable scope: global and local.

// Global Scope: Variables declared outside of functions 
//    The global keyword is used to access a global variable.

// Local Scope: Variables declared within a function e.g:

$globalVar = "I'm a global variable"; // Global variable

function testFunction() {
    $localVar = "I'm a local variable"; // Local variable
    echo $localVar; // Output: I'm a local variable
    echo "<br>"; // HTML line break for better readability

    // global $globalVar;
    echo $globalVar; // Output: I'm a global variable
}

testFunction(); // Calling the function

// Trying to access the local variable outside the function
// This will cause an error because $localVar is not accessible here
echo $localVar; // Error: Undefined variable: localVar

// static variable
// In PHP, a static variable within a function maintains its value between function calls.e.g:

function incrementCounter() {
    static $counter = 0;

    // ++ increment operator
    $counter++;
    echo "Counter value: $counter<br>";
}

incrementCounter();
incrementCounter();
incrementCounter();

// constants
// constants are like variables, but their values cannot be changed or redefined.e.g:
// define() function is used to create a constant.
// Constants are typically defined using uppercase letters.
// They are accessed without the leading dollar sign ($) unlike variables.e.g:

define("SITE_NAME", "My web-application"); // Define a constant named SITE_NAME with value "My web-application"

echo SITE_NAME; // Output: My web-application

// magic constants
// magic constants are predefined constants that change based on their usage. These constants begin with two underscores (__) and provide valuable information about the current environment, file, or code-execution-context

// 01. first of all, if you wana return the line number, you can use __LINE__
echo "The Line number is : " . __LINE__; 
echo "<br><br>";

// 02. if you wana return the full path of the executed file, you can use __FILE__
echo "The file name is : " . __FILE__; 
echo "<br><br>";


// 03. next, if you wana return the directory of the executed file, you can use __DIR__
echo "The directory is : " . __DIR__; 
echo "<br><br>";


// 04. moving on, if you wana return the name of the function, you can use __FUNCTION__

function exampleFunction() {
    echo "name of the function is: " . __FUNCTION__; // Outputs the function name
}
exampleFunction();
echo "<br><br>";

# 2. DATA TYPES
hey, whatâ€™s up guyz, 

welcome to the 2nd episode of "PHP with MySQL Crash Course for Beginners" DATA TYPES

data types represent the type of data that a variable or a constant can hold. PHP supports various data types, each with its specific characteristics and uses.

In PHP, variables can hold different types of data. Here are some common data types.\
(dataTypes.php)
```PHP
// Integer
// An integer is a fundamental data type used in programming to represent whole numbers without any decimal or fractional parts. 

$number = 42;
echo "Integer: $number<br>";


// Float (Floating Point Number)
// a float is a numeric data type that can represent decimal numbers such as: 3.14, -0.25, 100.0, etc.,

$floatNum = 3.14;
echo "Float: $floatNum<br>";

// String
// A string refers to a sequence of characters, such as letters, numbers, symbols, or spaces, arranged in a specific order, and enclosed within single quotes (' ') or double quotes (" ")

$stringVar = "Hello, PHP!";
echo "String: $stringVar<br>";

// Boolean
// Boolean is a data type that represents a logical value. It can have one of two possible states: true or false.

$isTrue = true;
$isFalse = false;
echo "Boolean (True): $isTrue<br>";
echo "Boolean (False): $isFalse<br>";

// Null
// null is a special-data-type that represents a variable with no value or a variable that has been explicitly set to null. 
$nullVar = null;
echo "Null: $nullVar<br>";

// Array
// an array is a data structure that stores multiple values in a single variable, You will learn more about it in its dedicated episode.
$myArray = array("apple", "banana", "orange");

echo "Array: ";
// print_r() is a function used for debugging purposes to display structured information such as an array in a human-readable format.
print_r($myArray);

echo "<br>";

// Object
// In PHP, an object is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows you to create an instance of a class. n You will learn more about it in its dedicated episode.
